          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600">Booking Your Journey</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            Upon receipt of your deposit (or full payment if applicable), we
            will email you a confirmation invoice detailing your arrangements.
            The price indicated on the confirmation invoice is guaranteed only
            upon receipt of full payment (please refer ‘Pricing Policy’ below).
            Please note that if you receive a quote from us for a booking but do
            not confirm it at that time, the price may change before you proceed
            with the booking. A verbal booking confirmation made over the phone
            is considered as firm as a written confirmation made at the same
            time.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Pricing Policy</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            All fares and information are subject to availability. Once a
            confirmation invoice has been issued, the price stated on that
            invoice may only change as outlined in this clause or if you make
            amendments to your booking. While we strive to avoid surcharges, we
            reserve the right to pass on any cost increases from suppliers.
            Airfares are subject to potential price increases by flight
            operators at any time. The price indicated on the confirmation
            invoice is guaranteed only upon receipt of full payment from you.
            Paying a deposit does not guarantee your seat or the price.
            <br />
            Prices may be adjusted due to government actions (e.g., VAT
            imposition), transportation cost increases (e.g., airfares, fuel),
            service fee changes (e.g., landing taxes), or currency fluctuations.
            Our price guarantee does not cover increases resulting from the
            aforementioned factors.
            <br />
            Pricing Errors: Although we endeavour to ensure the accuracy of
            pricing information, errors may occur. Upon identifying such errors,
            we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible. If you have an
            existing booking, you may choose to proceed with the corrected price
            or make amendments to your booking. We reserve the right to cancel
            the booking if you do not wish to accept the corrected price or any
            alternative quotes.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Deposit/Full Payments</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            No booking will be confirmed unless the required deposit (or full
            amount if applicable) has been received by us. Please see, ‘Pricing
            Policy’ above for full details. Deposits are non-refundable.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">
            Payment of Balances and Late Payments
          </h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            All bookings made within 10 weeks of departure must be paid in full
            at the time of booking. We are able to take a deposit if a booking
            is made more than 10 weeks before your departure date, but the full
            balance must be received by us no later than 10 weeks prior to your
            departure date. You must pay the balance by the due date shown on
            your confirmation invoice. It is very important that you pay
            balances when due because failure to do so may lead to the
            cancellation of your holiday and still leave you liable to
            cancellation charges.
            <br />
            In addition, late payments will be subject to a Late Payment Fee
            surcharge of £25.00 per booking. Please note that prices can go up,
            and your booking price can only be guaranteed if paid in full. We
            therefore recommend that you pay in full if you wish to guarantee
            the price of your holiday.
            <br />
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Payment Methods</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            The simplest and most efficient way to pay us all or part of your
            balance is by bank transfer; our account details can be found on
            your booking confirmation invoice.
            <br />
            If payment for your booking is made using an American Express card,
            credit card, or debit card, an administration charge may apply. The
            exact charge will depend on the type of card used.
            <br />
            We reserve the right to refuse personal cheques as a method of
            payment. On those occasions when a personal cheque has been accepted
            as a form of payment, please note that we need to receive the cheque
            a minimum of 5 working days before your balance due date for the
            cheque to clear. ​

            Minor Changes to Your Holiday
          </h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            If we are obliged to make any minor change in the arrangements for
            your holiday, we will inform you as soon as possible.

            Major Changes to Your Holiday
          </h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            If before you depart we have to make any major change to your
            holiday arrangements (e.g., changes of departure time of more than
            12 hours, change of airport) it will only be because we are forced
            to do so by circumstances usually beyond our control. In such an
            unlikely event, we will inform you immediately and aim to minimize
            your inconvenience. We will offer alternative arrangements as close
            as possible to your original choice. You will then have a choice of
            accepting the alternative arrangements, taking another available
            holiday of similar price, or canceling. If you choose to cancel, you
            will be reimbursed all monies paid to us. ​
            <br />
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Force Majeure</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            Please be aware that some suppliers, such as carriers, impose
            cancellation fees and apply restrictions that are not within our
            control and for which we cannot be held liable. In these situations,
            the term “force majeure” may be applied. Force majeure refers to
            unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the
            travel agent or other suppliers of services, the consequences of
            which could not have been avoided even with all due care. We cannot
            accept responsibility if, as a result of circumstances beyond our
            control, we have to change your package after departure or if we, or
            our suppliers, cannot supply your package as agreed or if you suffer
            any loss or damage.
            <br />

          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Group Holidays</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            Some of our holidays are based on a minimum number of participants,
            and if these numbers are not reached, we reserve the right to cancel
            the trip and refund all payments made. Prices are subject to
            increase if the group size is reduced. ​
            <br />

          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Flights</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            Details of airlines, flight numbers/schedules, and destination
            airports will be shown on your confirmation invoice. We regret we
            are unable to guarantee specific aircraft types or airlines. A
            flight described as ‘direct’ will not necessarily be non-stop. All
            departure/arrival times are provided by the airlines concerned and
            are estimates only. They may change due to air traffic control
            restrictions, weather conditions, operational/maintenance
            requirements, and passenger check-in requirements. We are not liable
            for any changes to departure/arrival times or any other changes.

          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Insurance</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            We strongly recommend that you take out adequate travel insurance.
            We recommend that you read the terms of your travel insurance to
            satisfy yourself about the coverage.

            Making a Booking - Lead Passenger Name / Other Passenger Names
          </h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            When you make a booking, you guarantee that, as the lead name, you
            have the authority to accept and do accept, on behalf of your party,
            the terms of these booking conditions and those of any suppliers. It

          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Changing Your Arrangements</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            If you wish to change any item – other than increasing the number of
            persons in your party – and we can accommodate the change, you will
            have to pay an Amendment Fee per person. Changes must be confirmed
            to us in writing. ​

          <h2 className="text-20 fw-600 mt-35">Cancellation</h2>
          <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
            Should you or any member of your party be forced to cancel your
            holiday, we must be notified in writing by the person who made the
            booking. The cancellation charges are calculated from the date we
            receive the written notice of cancellation and are shown as a
            percentage of the total holiday cost. Please note that flights and
            hotels are non-refundable unless otherwise specified. Any
            cancellation fees incurred during the process will be your
            responsibility.
